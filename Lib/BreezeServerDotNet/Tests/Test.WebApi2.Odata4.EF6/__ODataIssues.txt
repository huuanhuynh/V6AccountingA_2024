ODataConventionModelBuilder is @!#$% up. ( version )

- No foreign key properties
- incorrect association names - ( inverse properties cannot be determined)
- no info about store generated keys ( identity columns)
- no maxLength for strings
- no datatype nullability info - ( non-nullability is purely defined based on whether the field is part of the pk or has a 'required' on it.) 
- no etag support
- no enum support
- json schema tag - puts entityContainer information in a seperate item from {entityType and complexType info} and uses a magic namespace of 'Default' ( undocumented anywhere)
